	<!-- <h1>Warning: Beware of fraudulent websites</h1> -->
	<p>We have recently become aware of fraudulent websites that are impersonating our official site. These fake websites are designed to deceive customers into believing they are purchasing genuine services from us. To protect yourself from these scams, please read the following information carefully.</p>


	<h2>How to identify a fraudulent website / social media pages</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Check the URL</b>: Always ensure you are on our official website by checking the URL in your browserâ€™s address bar. Our official website is <a href="https://www.croneri.co.uk">https://www.croneri.co.uk</a>. Be cautious of any slight variations in the URL.</li>
		<li><b>Look for Secure Connections</b>: Our website uses HTTPS to secure your data. Look for a padlock symbol in the address bar and ensure the URL begins with "https://".</li>
		<li><b>Verify Contact Information</b>: Fraudulent websites often lack proper contact information. Ensure that the contact details match those listed on our official site.</li>
		<li><b>Examine the Website Design</b>: While fraudulent sites may look similar, they often have subtle differences in design and layout. Compare the site with our official website to spot any inconsistencies.</li>
		<li><b>Check that the social media account is verified</b>: This can be easily determined by the blue tick badge that we use on our social media accounts.</li>
		<li><b>Look for improper spelling or grammar</b>: Inconsistencies within the website could mean the website has been quickly set up without attention to detail.</li>
		<li><b>Be aware of a lot of advertising pop-ups</b>:, Look out for calls for urgent action before a time limit is reached, such as expiring discounts or sales.</li>
	</ul>
