	<li>3.	VAT is added to commission as appropriate and will be paid on receipt of a valid VAT invoice. </li>
	<li>4.	Commission will be paid in full once the contract has been signed by the customer and received by Croner-i at its head office, and the first three payments have been received.</li>

<h2>SCHEDULE 2 - GDPR COMPLIANCE STATEMENT – CRONER-I LIMITED</h2>
<h3>Commitment </h3>
<p>We are committed to the principles inherent in the GDPR and particularly to the concepts of privacy by design, the right to be forgotten, consent and a risk-based approach. In addition, we aim to ensure:</p>
<ul>
	<li>transparency with regard to the use of data</li>
	<li>that any processing is lawful, fair, transparent and necessary for a specific purpose</li>
	<li>that data is accurate, kept up to date and removed when no longer necessary</li>
	<li>that data is kept safely and securely.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Policy</h3>
<p>Our privacy policy is available on our website (<a href="https://www.croneri.co.uk/privacy-policy">www.croneri.co.uk/privacy-policy</a>) and a copy has been made available to all employees and to contractors and suppliers associated with this organisation. It forms part of the induction training of all new staff and follow-up sessions will be put in place if the legislation changes or further guidance is available.</p>

<h3>Right to be forgotten</h3>
<p>We recognise the right to erasure, also known as the right, to be forgotten, laid down in the GDPR. Individuals should contact <a href="mailto:gdpr@croner.com">GDPR@croner.co.uk</a> with requests for the deletion or removal of personal data. These will be acted on provided there is no compelling reason for continued processing and that the exemptions set out in the GDPR do not apply. These exemptions include where the personal data is processed for the exercise or defence of legal claims and to comply with a legal obligation for the performance of a public interest task or exercise of official authority.</p>

<h3>Subject access requests </h3>
<p>We recognise that individuals have the right to access their personal data and supplementary information and will comply with the one-month timeframe for responses set down in the GDPR. As a rule, a copy of the requested information will be provided free of charge although we reserve the right to charge a “reasonable fee” when a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly if it is repetitive. If this proves necessary, the data subject will be informed of their right to contest our decision with the supervisory authority (the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)).</p>
As set out in the GDPR, any fee will be notified in advance and will be based on the administrative cost of providing the information.

<h3>Privacy </h3>
<p>We will implement data protection “by design and by default”, as required by the GDPR. Safeguards will be built into products and services from the earliest stage of development and privacy-friendly default settings will be the norm. The privacy notice, which is on our website, and which is provided to anyone from whom we collect data, explains our lawful basis for processing the data and gives the data retention periods. It makes clear that individuals have a right to complain to the ICO. Where we identify there may be an operational change or alterations to the ways we process and manage data, a privacy impact assessment (PIA) or a full Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) will be undertaken. We also perform ongoing analysis on our internal processes and data handling procedures.</p>

<h3>Privacy Information Notices</h3>
<p>The privacy information notices for website visitors can be accessed at <a href="https://www.croneri.co.uk/privacy-policy">www.croneri.co.uk/privacy-policy</a>. </p>
<p>The privacy information notices for existing and former customers can be accessed at <a href="https://www.croneri.co.uk/privacy-policy">www.croneri.co.uk/privacy-policy</a>.</p>
<p>Data Sharing and International Transfers We have put recognised procedures and safeguarding measures in place to secure, encrypt and maintain the integrity of any personal data that is transferred. When we share data with an external third party; these operations are governed by a Data Processing Agreement (DPA), and we perform regular due diligence on any external companies we work with to ensure that high levels of data integrity are maintained.</p>
<p>Data transfers taking place from within the EEA to outside the EEA are only permitted with the provision of an Adequacy decision, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC’s) or any other lawful transfer mechanism. </p>

<h3>Children</h3>
<p>The GDPR provides for special protection for children’s personal data, and we will comply with the requirement to obtain parental or guardian consent for any data processing activity involving anyone under the age of 16. Systems have been introduced to verify individuals’ ages.</p>

<h3>Data loss</h3>
<p>If a data breach occurs that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the people affected will be informed as soon as possible and the ICO will be notified within 72 hours.</p>

<h3>GDPR contact</h3>
<p>Any questions related to GDPR or to issues concerning data protection generally should initially be addressed to <a href="mailto:gdpr@croner.com">gdpr@croner.com.</a></p>
