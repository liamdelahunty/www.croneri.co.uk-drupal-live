        <h2 class="h4">On working with Croner-i</h2>

        <p>Croner-i's Rudy John-Baptiste spoke to Dan Howard Managing Director of <a href="https://www.brandaccountancy.com" target="_blank">Brand Accountancy Limited</a> who had the following to say about his business and working with Croner-i.</p>

        <blockquote class="mx-5">
            <p>"We are an accountancy practice that is passionate about helping small businesses to really understand their finances by offering a complete package of services. Quite often new businesses when starting out may have no idea of finances whether the issue is being unsure on what is allowed to be claimed, what their filing deadlines are, how to record their financial information. With BA focusing on the finance side of things, our clients can then focus on what they do best and are passionate about.</p>
            <p>Brand Accountancy provide a QuickBooks subscription and help/guidance for all clients so that clients have their financial data in real time.</p>
            <p>We consider ourselves a pro-active firm of accountants who keep in regular contact with their clients throughout the year rather than just popping up after the year-end or tax year-end to request information. This ensures that our clients are planning for tax efficiently, and they are taking the opportunities available to them.</p>
            <p>Croner-i has been a massive help as when a second opinion is needed, even if we are almost certain on the answer, we can just get what we are thinking verified. We look at Croner-i as that extra employee (with lots of tax knowledge!).</p>
            <p>An example of how it has helped usâ€¦ During January we had completed 95% of tax returns on our existing clients, this allowed us to take on those filers who had left it to the last minute (new clients). This meant that we had to deal with a high number of tax queries, some of which were a bit more complex than others. We obtained the help of Croner-i in this period. Ultimately this resulted in being able to get through the tax returns quicker than if we did not have Croner-i."</p>
